<p>In leader cell cells:
<ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In follower cell cells:
<ul>
<li>pressure decreases cycle entry from 0 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 1 and Hill power 4.</li>
<li>oxygen increases cycle entry from 0 towards 0.002 with a Hill response, with half-max 21.5 and Hill power 4.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In cancer cells:
<ul>
<li>pressure decreases cycle entry from 0 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 1 and Hill power 4.</li>
<li>oxygen increases cycle entry from 0 towards 0.002 with a Hill response, with half-max 21.5 and Hill power 4.</li>
<li>oxygen decreases necrosis from 0.003 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 3.75 and Hill power 8.</li>
<li>oxygen decreases migration speed from 1 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 7.5 and Hill power 4.</li>
<li>oxygen increases cell-cell adhesion from 0.04 towards 0.4 with a Hill response, with half-max 7.5 and Hill power 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>In microglia cells:
<ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In astrocyte cells:
<ul>
<li>pressure decreases cycle entry from 0 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 1 and Hill power 4.</li>
<li>oxygen increases cycle entry from 0 towards 0.0004 with a Hill response, with half-max 21.5 and Hill power 4.</li>
