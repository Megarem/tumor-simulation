Cell Hypothesis Rules

In leader cell cells:

In follower cell cells:
pressure decreases cycle entry
oxygen increases cycle entry

In cancer cells:
pressure decreases cycle entry
oxygen increases cycle entry
oxygen decreases necrosis
oxygen decreases migration speed
oxygen increases cell-cell adhesion

In microglia cells:

In astrocyte cells:
pressure decreases cycle entry
oxygen increases cycle entry
