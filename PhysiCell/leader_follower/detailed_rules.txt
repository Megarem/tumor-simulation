Cell Hypothesis Rules (detailed)

In leader cell cells:

In follower cell cells:
pressure decreases cycle entry from 0 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 1 and Hill power 4.
oxygen increases cycle entry from 0 towards 0.002 with a Hill response, with half-max 21.5 and Hill power 4.

In cancer cells:
pressure decreases cycle entry from 0 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 1 and Hill power 4.
oxygen increases cycle entry from 0 towards 0.002 with a Hill response, with half-max 21.5 and Hill power 4.
oxygen decreases necrosis from 0.003 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 3.75 and Hill power 8.
oxygen decreases migration speed from 1 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 7.5 and Hill power 4.
oxygen increases cell-cell adhesion from 0.04 towards 0.4 with a Hill response, with half-max 7.5 and Hill power 4.

In microglia cells:

In astrocyte cells:
pressure decreases cycle entry from 0 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 1 and Hill power 4.
oxygen increases cycle entry from 0 towards 0.0004 with a Hill response, with half-max 21.5 and Hill power 4.
